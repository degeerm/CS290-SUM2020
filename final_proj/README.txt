Final Project
Author: Miya DeGeer

Description: Final project for CS-290 course. Simple 4 page site
about rats. 

-+-+-IMPORTANT NOTES-+-+-

*ALL REQUIRED ELEMENT LOCATIONS
 -Carousel: Home Page. (/) (Only autoscrolls when mouse is not on element.
  Takes about 5 seconds for image to switch.)
 -Unordered List: Information Page (/information)
 -Scroll Box: Misinformation Page (/misinformation)
 -Form: Form Page (/form-page). Submits via a POST to HTTPBin, and
  shows the user what they entered to show the submit is working. Also
  submits to MYSQL database.
 -Download Link: Information Page (/information), inside of the third
  yellow text box (the one with the scrollbar, at bottom)
 -External Links: All four pages.

*I tried to make the site somewhat responsive, but an issue in my personal
 life made time kind of short. You'll see this attempt in some of my pages,
 however, the optimal resolution for viewing the site is 1200x500. I couldn't
 get it to be very responsive with the time I had.

*The form submits to a MYSQL database. You can see that in formScript.js and
 in script.js with /insert-opinion. This took me longer than I'd like to admit!
 All information will populate to right of form when submitted.

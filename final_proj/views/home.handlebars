  <h3>Welcome to the Rat Zone</h3>
  <p>
    One of the most under-appreciated animals, I think, is the rat. They've gotten a reputation of being an 
    annoying pest, and scary little disease-carriers. And this is half true! Wild rats can be a serious burden
    on food supplies, crops, and everyday living. That being said, part of the story isn't being told here. Rats
    are incredibly intelligent little creatures, and are actually really fascinating animals. They even make
    excellent pets!

  <h4>Wait... Why a site about rats?</h4>
  <p>
    Granted, I probably could have used this opportunity to create a spot for my resume and personal achievements, to be used
    for job hunting. But quite frankly, when I sat down to plan that out, it felt like a chore to do. Which makes sense, creating
    a website for your CV isn't exactly a Saturday-night activity. So, I figured I'd make this a silly website I could have some
    fun with. And hey, what better topic than one of my favorite animals? Rats get a pretty bad rap, and I thought it'd be a fun way
    to compile a lot of my thoughts on them in one place.

    When you try to find information about rats, you often find stuff from pest-control websites. Which makes sense, again, they
    can be very annoying pests. But it's a little disheartening when you're trying to learn some positive facts about them! Here,
    there's a lot of informative fun-facts, and rebuttle of common misconceptions. Plus, lots of good rat pictures. They're cuter
    than you think they'd be.
